# Hey, I'm Chandan — Builder of Bots, Backends, and Bold Ideas

> *“You don't need permission to build the future.”*

I'm an **Engineering undergrad at MNNIT Allahabad**, but my world revolves around building tech that *works* — whether it's an event-scale leaderboard, a messaging system with live encryption, or a bot that speaks for you on video.

I've shipped products that hundreds of users interact with, mentored juniors in my coding club, and contributed to startup events that needed reliable tech under pressure. My work lives at the intersection of **real-time systems**, **open-source tooling**, and **AI-powered automation**.

## ⚙️ Current Experiments

- 🧱 Creating ** Anki like platform for devs** (auth, payments, dashboards) — so devs can remember stuff.
- 🤖 Building **AI agents** that can hold video calls, filter calendars, and speak like humans.
- 🌐 Exploring **Web3** and **autonomous automation** tools for self-operating platforms.

## 🛠️ Projects That I have worked on

### 🎯 [College Hunt](https://github.com/ChandanYadav13/College-Hunt)
> Gamified QR-based treasure hunt with real-time leaderboards and voucher redemptions.

- Redis-backed leaderboard with <500ms latency at peak
- Powering 50+ events, 1000+ scans
- Built for performance, fun, and chaos-handling

### 🎥 [Meet.ai](https://github.com/PiyushM12/meet.ai)
> AI-powered video agent platform with seamless scheduling, filtering & agent orchestration.

- Modular monorepo structure using `app/` and `module/`
- tRPC + WebRTC + Stream SDK = magical performance
- Designed for scalability and plug-in AI behaviors

### 🔒 [Secure P2P Messaging](https://github.com/ChandanYadav13/Secure-Anonymous-Messaging)
> Anonymous chats with encryption, JWT auth, and an auto-responder bot.

- 80%+ queries handled by an integrated bot
- Supports 50+ concurrent encrypted sessions

## 🌌 Bonus

I sometimes drop weird projects like:

- CLI tools that generate auth from scratch
- Browser bots that fill forms for you
- Real-time location-based leaderboards with penalties and points
